## Changes in scale of coral bleaching in the British Indian Ocean Territory.

### Corals are dying
The 2016 El Nino swept the world's oceans causing unprecedented rates of coral bleaching globally. Reports in October 2016 suggest that 80% of corals in the northern Great Barrier Reef are dead as a result of this warming event. Some evidence suggests that corals recover from bleaching faster when in fully protected marine protected areas (MPA)


Here is an image comparing healthy coral with bleached coral:

### project description
As part of a fish survey using baited remote underwater video systems (BRUVS) we have habitat data from the British Indian Ocean Territory MPA pre and post the 2016 bleaching event. This project would examine (1) whether BRUVS be used to detect bleaching and (2) the chance in incidence rate of bleaching pre event and at two points post bleaching.
